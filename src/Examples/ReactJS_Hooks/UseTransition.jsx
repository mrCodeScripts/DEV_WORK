/*
  useTransition() - React Hook for managing non-urgent UI updates (Concurrent Mode)

  Purpose:
  - Allows you to mark certain state updates as "transitions" (non-urgent) 
    so that React can keep the UI responsive while rendering heavy updates.
  - Keeps urgent interactions (typing, clicking buttons) instant.
  - Commonly used for search bars, live filtering, lazy-loading heavy components, 
    large tables, charts, and any expensive UI rendering.

  Syntax:
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
    - isPending: boolean indicating whether the transition is still in progress
    - startTransition(callback): wrap your non-urgent state updates inside this function

  Mechanics:
  1. React schedules the updates inside startTransition as low-priority.
  2. Urgent updates (typing, clicks) take priority and render immediately.
  3. Low-priority updates continue rendering in the background.
  4. isPending can be used to show feedback (e.g., loading spinners) during the transition.
  
  Key Points / Best Practices:
  - Use startTransition for any updates that are expensive or could block the UI.
    Examples: filtering large lists, updating heavy components, lazy-loaded content.
  - Urgent updates (like input values, button clicks) should remain outside startTransition.
  - Often combined with React.lazy and Suspense for lazy-loading large components 
    without freezing the UI.
  - Perfect for accessibility-friendly, responsive UIs where smoothness is critical.
  - Helps maintain "instant feedback" UX even when rendering multiple heavy elements.

  Example Use Cases:
  1. Search Bars / Live Filters:
     - Typing stays instant while filtering thousands of items happens in the background.
  2. Lazy-loading Components:
     - Heavy dashboards, charts, or tables can render without freezing the page.
  3. Tooltips / Expensive UI Updates:
     - Non-critical UI updates can be deferred without blocking user interaction.

  Summary:
  - useTransition separates urgent vs non-urgent work.
  - Improves perceived performance of complex or heavy UI.
  - Must still handle JS logic to actually update the DOM; useTransition only 
    tells React which updates can be lower priority.
  - Combine with isPending to provide user feedback during transitions.
